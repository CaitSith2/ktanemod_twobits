  Title: Two Bits Module
  Description: "[h1]About[/h1]\r\nThis poorly programmed lookup device is as maddening
    with its slow responses as it is unforgiving with ill-timed inputs. Patience required.\r\n\r\n[h1]Manual[/h1]\r\nhttps://bkane.github.io/ktane/mods/twobits/Manual/\r\n\r\n[h1]Notes[/h1]\r\nThis
    module has a lot of information hidden behind queries that the defuser must make.
    It is intentionally cumbersome to interact with and will require careful multi-tasking
    and time management when paired with other modules.\r\n\r\n[h1]Module type name[/h1]\r\nTwoBits\r\n\r\n[h1]Source
    Code[/h1]\r\nIf there are any developers interested in seeing how this mod was
    created, the source code can be found at https://github.com/bkane/ktanemod_twobits
    .\r"
